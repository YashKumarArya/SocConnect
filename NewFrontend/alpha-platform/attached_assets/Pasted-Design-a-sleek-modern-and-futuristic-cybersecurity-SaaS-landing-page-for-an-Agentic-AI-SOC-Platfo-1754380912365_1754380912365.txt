Design a sleek, modern, and futuristic cybersecurity SaaS landing page for an "Agentic AI SOC Platform" with a dark theme and neon glow accents. The overall look should feel premium, tech-focused, and minimalistic with a strong emphasis on AI-driven security.

**Hero Section:**
- Large headline: "Agentic AI SOC Platform" in glowing futuristic typography, with a smaller subtitle below describing the platform as an intelligent SOC automation solution.
- Prominent glowing button: "Request a Demo" centered under the text.
- Beside the text, display a futuristic AI conversation UI inside a glowing rectangle. Example content:
   - A question: “Is this incoming webhook critical?” with AI response: “Yes, escalate to Tier 2.”
   - Below it, a glowing purple text bubble: “What’s the reason? → Possible data breach flagged by source Crowd.”
- Use animated icons or small squares representing security events flowing towards an AI core in the middle.
