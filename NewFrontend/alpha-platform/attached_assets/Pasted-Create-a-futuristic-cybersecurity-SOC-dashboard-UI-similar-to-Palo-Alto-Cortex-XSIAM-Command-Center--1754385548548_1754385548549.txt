Create a futuristic cybersecurity SOC dashboard UI similar to Palo Alto Cortex XSIAM Command Center with the following specifications:

**General Theme:**
- Dark mode background (#0B0C10) with neon gradient accents (cyan, teal, and purple).
- Sleek, modern, futuristic look with clean typography (use 'Inter' or 'Poppins').
- Responsive layout, centered main visualization.

**Layout Sections:**
1. **Left Sidebar Navigation:**
   - Vertical menu on left with items:
     - Dashboards & Reports
     - Incident Response
     - Detection & Threat Intel
     - Assets
     - Endpoints
     - Marketplace
   - At bottom: Settings, Notifications, Profile info, and Help icon.
   - Style: Minimalistic icons with text, glowing hover effect.

2. **Main Dashboard Area:**
   - Greeting text: "Good Evening, [Username]" in white font.
   - Two main animated sections:
     - **Left Side Flow (Endpoints → Alerts):**
       - A column of logos/icons representing sources: NGFW, AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, Office 365, Proofpoint, Apache, Okta, Prisma Cloud, and "+36".
       - Each icon connects to a central node labeled **1,406 Alerts** using animated curved lines that glow and pulse (CSS animation).
     - **Right Side Flow (Incidents → Automated/Manual):**
       - Central node labeled **62 Incidents**, connected by curved glowing lines splitting into:
         - Automated (46) → glowing green line.
         - Manual (11) → glowing blue line.
       - Lines animate continuously to show data flow.
   - Center circle with pulsating dots to represent the AI engine (rotating subtle animation).
   
3. **Stats Below:**
   - Four small panels with real-time stats:
     - **Events Ingestion:** "22 GB / 24H" with a small line chart.
     - **Data Ingestion:** "36 TB / 24H" with a line chart.
     - **Total Open Incidents:** "12" with severity indicators (C3, H7, M5, L1).
     - **Prevented Events:** "157.5K" in bold.

**Animations:**
- Use SVG or Canvas for curved flow lines with gradient glowing effect.
- Continuous flowing animation along paths (simulate packet movement) using **CSS animations or GSAP**.
- Pulsating dots in the center circle (scale and opacity animation).
- Line charts animated using **Chart.js** or CSS keyframes.

**Styling & Colors:**
- Background: #0B0C10
- Primary Glow: Neon Teal (#00F6D2)
- Secondary Glow: Purple (#A259FF)
- Font Color: White (#FFFFFF)
- Buttons: Minimal glowing hover effect.

**Technology Stack:**
- HTML for structure.
- CSS (with keyframes for glowing animations).
- JavaScript for dynamic values and GSAP for line animations.
- Optional: Chart.js for mini graphs.

**Interactivity:**
- Hover effects on menu and stats.
- Data flows animate automatically on load.
- Responsive for large monitors.

**Overall Vibe:**
- High-tech, futuristic, SOC command center interface with real-time animated data flows.
