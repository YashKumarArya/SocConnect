Enhance the existing Alert Processing Workflow in the dashboard with immersive animations and visual effects to create a futuristic and interactive experience. The design should maintain the landing page theme and include the following animation elements:

1. Electricity Flow Animation
In the Vendor → AI Model → Outcome pipeline, show an animated glowing line representing the alert data flowing.

Use pulsating energy particles or sparks along the connector line to simulate electricity traveling from vendor to AI, then to outcome.

Animation should speed up when processing starts and slow down when idle.

2. Dynamic Status Transitions
When an alert moves from Vendor to AI, highlight the AI node with a pulsating glow and rotating ring animation.

When the AI predicts TP, FP, or Escalate:

TP (Green glow, expanding ripple effect).

FP (Orange glow, flicker animation).

Escalate (Red glow, pulse + bounce effect).

3. Real-Time Alert Injection Animation
When a new alert arrives:

Slide-in from the left sidebar with a smooth fade-in effect.

A particle burst effect when it enters the pipeline.

4. AI Model Prediction Effect
Show a rotating AI brain icon with a neural network pulse effect during prediction.

Add a loading wave animation over the AI node while processing.

5. Escalation Interaction
When an alert escalates:

Show a vertical electric beam animation linking the workflow to the Manual Intervention Panel.

Add a highlighted card pop-up with smooth zoom-in and hover glow.

6. Automation Feedback
For TP & FP automation:

Display a light trail animation flowing toward the Automation Panel.

Include confetti burst effect when auto-action completes successfully.

7. Background & UX Enhancements
Add a subtle animated gradient background (dark theme with neon accents).

Use micro-interactions:

Hovering over pipeline steps triggers a soft glow and tooltip fade-in.

Buttons have ripple click effect.

Ensure all animations are lightweight, smooth, and performance-optimized (CSS animations, GSAP, or Framer Motion). Maintain a futuristic cybersecurity theme with neon blue, purple, and green accents. Use dummy alert data for showcasing animations in the prototype.
