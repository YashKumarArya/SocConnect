reDesign a futuristic, responsive analytics dashboard aligned with the landing page theme (same color palette, typography, and button styles). The dashboard should cater to data analysts, include AI-powered automation, and feature the following components:

1. Frontend & Navigation
Top Navigation Bar with user profile, notifications, and quick action menu.

Sidebar Navigation with sections:
Dashboard | Alerts | Investigations | Model Responses | Analytics | Settings.

Dark/Light Mode Toggle matching the landing page aesthetic.

2. Data Visualization (AI-Assisted)
AI-generated Insights Panel:

Summarize trends, anomalies, and correlations automatically using natural language.

Provide predictive insights (e.g., forecast alert trends for next 7 days).

Interactive Charts & Graphs:

Line charts, bar charts, and pie charts for KPIs.

Dynamic Heatmaps & Radars for real-time alert intensity.

AI-driven suggestions for best visualization type based on dataset.

Automated Data Cleaning Indicator:

Show data quality score and missing value alerts with one-click AI-based fixes.

3. Alert Dashboard & Investigation Page
Active Alerts Table with columns: ID, Severity, Status, Assigned Analyst, Time, AI Recommendation.

AI Auto-Triage: Automatically assign priority and suggest resolution steps based on historical data.

Root Cause Analysis Panel: AI-generated probable causes for alerts.

Bulk Investigation Automation:

Group similar alerts automatically using clustering.

Provide one-click remediation suggestions.

4. Model Response Display
Real-time AI Model Output Viewer:

Show prediction results with confidence score and time stamps.

Include Explainability Features (XAI) – why the model made this prediction (SHAP/LIME visualization).

What-If Analysis Tool: Allow users to change input parameters and see how predictions change.

5. Time Logs & Activity Tracker
User Activity Timeline: Tracks logins, investigations, model queries.

Model Performance Logs: Accuracy, precision, drift detection alerts over time.

Anomaly Detection Logs: AI flags unusual behavior or alert patterns automatically.

6. AI-Driven Features for Data Analysts
Natural Language Querying (Chat with Data):

Analyst can type questions like “Show top 10 alerts by severity in last 7 days” and get results instantly.

Automated Report Generation:

Export AI-generated summary reports in PDF/Excel with charts & recommendations.

Data Correlation Finder: AI detects and highlights key correlations between metrics.

Predictive Modeling Section: Allow analysts to run AI models on historical data for forecasting.

Ensure the design is minimalistic yet futuristic, with smooth animations and intuitive UX. Include placeholders for AI-generated insights and dummy data for charts, tables, and alerts. Optimize for desktop and tablet screens.
