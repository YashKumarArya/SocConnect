# Overview

This is a comprehensive SOC platform with machine learning for automated threat detection (99.58% accuracy, 3 classes, 3.2M parameters), featuring Neo4j graph database capabilities, OCSF (Open Cybersecurity Schema Framework) normalization pipeline, real-time security event processing, and agentic AI integration. The system implements the complete architecture: Alert Sources → API Endpoints → Data Enrichment → OCSF Normalization → Database Storage → ML Model (via Kafka) + Neo4j Graph Analysis (via Agentic AI). The application processes 4,000+ authentic security alerts from CrowdStrike, Email, Firewall, and SentinelOne sources through OCSF-compliant pipelines for ML model compatibility.
